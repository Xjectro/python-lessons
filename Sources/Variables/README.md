# Variable = A container for a value (string, integer, float, boolean)

# A variable is a named location in memory that stores a value.

# Variable Naming Rules:

# 1. Must start with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or underscore (\_)

# 2. Can contain letters, numbers (0-9), and underscores (\_)

# 3. Cannot start with a number (0-9)

# 4. Cannot contain spaces or special characters (e.g., @, #, $, %, &, \*, etc.)

# 5. Case-sensitive (e.g., myVar and MyVar are different variables)

# 6. Cannot be a reserved keyword (e.g., if, else, while, for, etc.)

# 7. Should be descriptive and meaningful (e.g., user_age, total_price, etc.)

# 8. Use snake_case for variable names (e.g., user_name, total_price) for better readability

# 9. Avoid using single-letter variable names (e.g., a, b, c) unless in a loop or temporary context
